### hi, you can call me `sirus` even tho my username is [`sunandsand`](https://github.com/sunandsand).


i am looking forward to making minecraft related projects on github. (mainly texturepacks (aka resourcespacks))

i am trying to improve on my hand-painted normals (lol).

i am really addicted to minecraft shaders and it would be nice if i know how to make them.
